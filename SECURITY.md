# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

We currently support the latest release of ScoutOS. Older versions may not receive security updates.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security issue in ScoutOS, please report it privately by emailing [security@example.com](mailto:security@example.com) or by opening a private GitHub security advisory. `security@example.com` is an example addressâ€”replace it with your actual security contact.
We will respond as quickly as possible and coordinate a fix.

Please do not publicly disclose security issues until we have had a chance to address them.
