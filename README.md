# ScoutOS

This repository contains the code and server setup script for deploying ScoutOS.

To provision a new server, run the `setup_scoutos_server.sh` script on your Ubuntu-based host. The script installs Docker, clones this repository, configures Nginx with SSL, and sets up monitoring via Prometheus Node Exporter.
