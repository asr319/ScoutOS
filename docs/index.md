ScoutOS provides a lightweight monitoring and deployment platform. The stack
combines a **FastAPI** backend with a **React** dashboard and is bundled using
**Docker Compose** for easy setup.
It now ships with a basic AI chat page for testing backend integrations.

For step‑by‑step installation and server instructions, see the
[project README](../README.md).
